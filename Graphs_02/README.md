## Graphs project 02

## Description
This repository contains solutions for one of our assignments on Graphs. This one consists of six exercises. Exercises cover topics such as graphic sequences, graph randomization, finding connected components, checking if graph is Eulerian and Hamiltonian and generating k-regular graphs. 

## Running our program
To run our program, you simply need to type make in your bash console and then run the Project2 file. Our program is interactive, which means that user can choose which of the problems described above he wants to solve. 

## Additional Python script
This repository contains also simple Python script that we used for testing our solutions. Script is called plotGraph.py. It uses Matplotlib to plot graphs. To use this script user needs a file with a graph saved as an adjacency matrix. Files like that are produced by our project.
